# MachineLearning_Asteroids
Investigation whether machine learning methods can be used to facilitate the mapping of the solar system.

As of 17 August 2020, 991,909 asteroids are already known in our solar system (source: https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?body_count). 
The aim of this project is to investigate whether machine learning methods can be used to facilitate the mapping of the solar system. 
To do this, I investigate whether the size of asteroids can be predicted using other parameters. To do this, I consider the available dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/basu369victor/prediction-of-asteroid-diameter), 
based on the database of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Asteroid Dataset. 
In addition to various other parameters, the dataset contains a variable diameter for each asteroid, i.e. the diameter of the celestial body that is to be the target variable of my prediction model. 
The task is to carry out an exploration of the dataset and then to predict the diameter variable with a suitable model.
